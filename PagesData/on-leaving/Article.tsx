    <h2 id="asasansei">As a Sansei</h2>
    <p>Since I was a child, I was immersed in Japanese culture.</p>
    <p>
      At home, my <code>ba-chans</code> and <code>ji-chans</code> (grandparents)
      always tried to communicate in Japanese with me. The amazing Japanese food
      was part of my every day. And I used the manners daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every Sansei (Sansei stands for “the third generation of Japanese people
      born in another country“) should remember using these phrases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>おやすみなさい (good night) before going to bed</li>
      <li>or いってきます (see you later) before leaving the house</li>
      <li>
        or いただきます (let’s eat or thanks for the food) before starting to
        eat the food
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Three days a week I also went to a 日本語学校 (Japanese school) to learn
      Japanese, but also be immersed in the culture. Made a lot of friends whom
      I relate to. Participated in Undokai (it’s a Japanese sports day) with all
      my friends’ families.
    </p>
    <p>Japan is part of me.</p>
    <h2 id="thejapantrip">The Japan trip</h2>
    <p>
      In 2019 I had the opportunity to take vacation days and travel to Japan
      with my friends. It was an amazing experience that{' '}
      <a href="https://leandrotk.medium.com/hist%C3%B3rias-do-jap%C3%A3o-13a0cddd9ac">
        I documented with photos and an article
      </a>{' '}
      (Portuguese content!).
    </p>
    <p>
      With all trips, it comes with what we call in Portuguese “Perrengues“
      (it’s a funny way to say “travel problems“).
    </p>
    <p>
      But even though I had travel issues, I had unforgettable moments there. I
      went to a lot of different places (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima,
      Yokohama, and Okayama), tried different foods (most of them remember me of
      my family’s food), and could enjoy the beautiful places.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there’s one thing travel teaches us, it’s that the journey is just as
      important as the destination. And the journey showed a new possibility.
      The possibility of experiencing this culture, that’s new and part of me at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back home, to my lovely country Brazil, I decided to plan and
      prepare (mentally and also technically) to move to Japan and have this new
      experience in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had many different opportunities in terms of moving abroad, but this
      travel made a huge difference in my decision.
    </p>
    <h2 id="companiesinjapansmartnews">Companies in Japan &amp; SmartNews</h2>
    <p>
      If I received an offer from a Japanese company, I think it would be an
      easy decision as I wanted to experience this. But I also thought about my
      career. So I was looking for a company that could provide me a great
      career experience:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>in software engineering</li>
      <li>an international culture</li>
      <li>
        a place I could use English to communicate as I’m still (re)learning
        Japanese
      </li>
      <li>a good culture, interesting products, and technical challenges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      SmartNews was one of the companies that caught my attention. I attended
      different events like the “
      <em>Life in a Japanese Unicorn as a Software Engineer</em>“ that was very
      interesting to understand the engineers’ perspectives about working at
      SmartNews. Even though I needed to wake up at 6 a.m. to attend these
      events, it was worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did I attend these events but I also{' '}
      <a href="https://careers.smartnews.com/">read the career page</a> and
      watched some videos about{' '}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmXoI6XbgS8&t=5s&ab_channel=SmartNews">
        working at SmartNews
      </a>{' '}
      and the{' '}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ9sWRSvU8g&ab_channel=SmartNews">
        engineering challenges
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked the company’s mission and values. My favorite value is the{' '}
      <code>For the Common Good</code> (Be a valuable contributor to society.
      Make a direct commitment to build a better world and help the content
      ecosystem thrive).
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that the work you do has a real impact on society is gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the interviews, I could understand a bit more of the company’s
      culture and how diverse and global they are. I was looking to work in an
      international environment with a lot of different cultures that I could
      learn from every single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also sure that SmartNews’ interviews were the toughest process I
      participated in my entire career. The company has a high hiring bar for
      engineering talents and it will be amazing to work with so many
      interesting and talented people.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the reason the company has a high hiring bar for engineers is because
      of the complex and interesting technical challenges it has to provide the
      best experience for the users.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was great to be challenged in the interviews and also have the
      opportunity to interview them, ask a lot of questions to make my decision.
      And I made.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whyamimovingtotokyo">Why am I moving to Tokyo?</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t have one big reason to move to Japan or more specifically Tokyo.
      Part of me just wants to go YOLO, have this experience, and see what
      happens next. The other part is way more conscious and rational. So I
      needed to document a list of reasons why to please the rational TK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Japan is part of me. I joke with my friends that in Brazil I feel I’m
      Japanese. In Japan, I feel I’m Brazilian. But the Japanese culture was
      always part of me and my family and I want to explore more this part of
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traveling within Brazil and to other countries made me rethink how things
      are, learn how to make things differently, and embrace new cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in another country is a huge opportunity to immerse me in the
      culture and learn the language. I had this opportunity of learning
      Japanese when I was a child, but I missed it. Now that I have the “second
      chance“, it’ll be awesome to learn a third language and be immersed in the
      culture. Learning a local language is part of knowing the culture in
      depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tokyo has an international vibe and this could be a big factor in terms of
      adaptability. I like nature, but I love being where things happen. Maybe
      this is why I always liked living in Sao Paulo. They have similarities in
      terms of infrastructure and convenience, even though Tokyo is much safer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m also aware of the work culture in Japan. But as SmartNews is a more
      “Silicon Valley“ kind of company, I didn’t worry about it. Also, in Tokyo
      is easier to find more international companies that have a better culture
      fit with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, I know that Japan is not a perfect country, like any other
      country in the world, so I’m setting the right expectations to not be
      frustrated when starting living there. I’ll probably like some things and
      dislike others. It’s part of the trade-off.
    </p>
    <h2 id="pointofdiscomfortfailure">Point of discomfort &amp; Failure</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Do something that makes you uncomfortable every day. Get out of your
        comfort zone.” - David Goggins
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Seeking discomfort to learn more and grow is one of the things I’m
      thinking about a lot these days. And what’s the most uncomfortable
      environment if not moving abroad, changing jobs, learning a new language,
      and embracing a new culture at the same time?
    </p>
    <p>
      I keep asking myself which one is riskier: to do and fail or not to do and
      have regret?
    </p>
    <p>
      As Kobe Bryant said,{' '}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js8OfeEL4jI&ab_channel=MykChiz">
        failure doesn’t exist

      . If you “fail“ Monday, try Tuesday. If you “fail“ Tuesday, try Wednesday.
      I want to keep going, keep growing, and{' '}
      <a href="https://leandrotk.github.io/2020/06/designing-my-lifes-system/index.html">
        enable myself to understand more about the world (and about myself)
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      I usually have two different pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of
      regret. And I want to always consciously choose the pain of discipline.
    </p>

    <h2>For the future</h2>

    <p>
      I have a lot of plans for my life, experiences I want to have, and things
      I want to learn.{' '}
      <a href="https://twitter.com/leandrotk_/status/1443936035105292288">
        I don’t see myself settling down on things I know
      </a>
      , and I want to use this intellectual vitality to get to know everything.
      With no priority in mind:

        <em>Learn Japanese</em> (日本語のべんきょうがんばてね！)
      </li>

        <em>Photography</em>: I can’t wait to take photos of the beautiful city
        of Tokyo.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Filmography</em>: I’ve been studying it and it’s fascinating the art
        of capturing feelings and behavior. I see myself doing long-format
        videos/documentaries about things I find interesting.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Traveling</em>: embracing the culture won’t happen in my apartment.
        I want to travel as much as possible and get to know the beautiful
        places in Japan’s provinces, meet new people.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Writing</em>: I’ve been blogging for 7 years now. But mostly about
        programming. I want to expand the topics and write about other things I
        find interesting like, culture, languages, travel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Tech</em>: I was in backend, fullstack, and frontend roles. I want
        to have time (and energy) to learn more about system programming and
        data science (I want to learn these things with my future colleagues as
        SmartNews is well-known as a Machine Learning company). I’m also doing{' '}
