      I often listen to music while working, writing, or when doing anything
      “knowledge-work“ related. But most of the time, I don’t have any specific
      music that I want to listen to, and a playlist I usually use to listen to
      while working. So I open YouTube and try to find anything that I would
      like.

    <p>
      The only thing I needed was to do the work, I didn’t need music, I didn’t
      need YouTube, but suddenly I’m procrastinating, watching useless videos,
      and being stuck on YouTube rabbit hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time this happens I reflect on two things: the first one is the
      attention economy and the second is how to design better systems.
    </p>
    <h2 id="theattentioneconomy">The Attention Economy</h2>
    <p>
      We live in a world that everybody is trying to get your attention: on
      social media, advertisement, influencers, TV, people around you.
      Everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having the attention means visibility, and today, this number is very
      important when it comes to monetizing things. Our “beautiful“ capitalist
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s easy to be distracted by the physical world — TV, friends, colleagues
      — and the digital world — any new shiny social media, ads, notifications.
      I’m not saying that they are bad things, even though most of the time they
      can be. My theory is that it’s easy to “say yes!“ to things that don’t
      matter to you. Because they are entertaining or just a tool to
      potentialize your procrastination.
    </p>
    <p>I don’t want to be a prisoner of distractions.</p>
    <h2 id="howtodesignbettersystems">How to design better systems</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing that I always think about is to use my energy on things I
      can control.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I can’t control social media’s algorithm. But I can remove the app from
        my phone.
      </li>
      <li>
        I can’t control TV entertainment shows. But I can turn it off — or just
        not buy it at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        I can’t control people texting me. But I can separate work time from
        leisure time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The idea is to focus on things that I can control and create systems that
      can support this concept.
    </p>
    <p>What do I do to control distractions?</p>
    <p>
      I have some tools and systems I use to help me don’t on the
      procrastination rabbit hole, but I’m still improving it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mobile">Mobile</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Whenever I’m working, I put my phone in airplane mode.</li>
      <li>
        Set up social media to not send too many notifications, just the good
        amount that I find healthy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Depending on the social media, I delete it from my phone and just take a
        break from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have a “list“ on my phone to remember the habits I want to cultivate
        daily.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="desktop">Desktop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I use an extension called Work Mode to block social media — or any other
        website I configure — when I’m working.
      </li>
      <li>
        Twitter
        <ul>
          <li>
            I use an extension called Demetricator to remove the number of
            followers, likes, retweets. I think it helps me focus on some
            content and not too much on trendy things.
          </li>
          <li>
            I usually use lists instead of following people. As I have a small
            number of people I follow, Twitter’s home doesn’t have too much
            content there. I open, don’t see anything new, and close the app.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Ads are very distracting too, and most of the time, they are not
        interesting to me. I AdBlock them.
      </li>
      <li>
        As I told you in the beginning, I usually use YouTube to listen to music
        while studying or working. So instead of opening the website, I have a
        Spotify playlist to work on and a bookmarked playlist on YouTube. So
        every time I want to listen to music while working, it’s just basically
        one click — instead of hours of procrastination.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="system">System</h3>
    <p>
      But I’m not only distracted by these things. I’m also distracted by the
      future or the next things I want to do on that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do two simple things here: one thing at a time and being conscious about
      my day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thing concept is very simple: Instead of multitasking, I focus on
      only one thing. My head is thinking only about that one thing. It has a
      start, middle, and end. After finishing it, I can think about other
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though it’s simple, it’s also difficult to execute. My head is always
      thinking about the future and it brings me a lot of anxiety. What is the
      next thing? Everything is planned? Can I do everything I plan today?
    </p>
    <p>
      To focus on that one thing is a constant battle against my head and
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to be conscious about my day is to plan. I create a simple list of
      things I want to do and prioritize it. Sometimes I put too many things.
      Sometimes I put not that many. So I usually adjust through the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planning is also a battle against my inner ambitions. I want everything.
      For today! But it’s not how things work. I won’t have time to do
      everything I want, so saying no is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planning also helps me calm my anxiety. I planned, so I know what I need
      to do. I don’t need to be constantly debating with my brain what are the
      next things.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that I also learned was to create space for serendipity. I don’t
      want to make my calendar works as lego and place every little detail
      there. Without any space to breathe and use my intuition. Time for
      reflections is so important in my life that I have “meetings“ on my
      calendar to have time to just think about anything.
    </p>
    <h2 id="finalwords">Final words</h2>
    <p>
      I do want to do great things and time is one of the things that we can’t
      waste. If most of my time I’m wasting on useless things, I won’t
      accomplish my goals and live my life the way I want. Focusing on things I
      can control and systems to fight distractions and procrastination is the
      way to go.
