      '3 years ago I remember I wrote what type of person I wanted to be. One of the things I wrote was "a person who does whatever, however, whenever, wherever he wants". This stuck with me because this is my definition of `freedom`. I want to taste this feeling now, to bring this concept to real life. This is why I built this microblog. A place I can share anything I want. There\'s no limitation. There\'s no 180 characters, no expectations from other people, no need to capitalize this. Just me and my own thoughts.',
