I've been studying [mathematics for machine learning](/series/mathematics-for-machine-learning) so I decided to build a table of math symbols to help me with active recall and memorizing them.

### Symbols Table

A table of math symbols for active recall:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>âˆ€</td>
    <td>"for all" or "for every" in predicates and logical expressions</td>
  </tr>
</table>
