As you may know, I've been studying compilers. A lot. For the past month, I've been learning more about the TypeScript compiler, reading its source code, and implementing some of the exercises from the [mini-typescript](https://github.com/imteekay/mini-typescript).

In this post, I want to cover some of my learnings while reading the TypeScript compiler miniature's source code and implementing the exercises.

I divided this series into three parts and the following posts to cover everything about the TypeScript compiler. The first two are already published and you can take a look at them here:

- [A High Level Architecture of the TypeScript compiler](https://www.iamtk.co/a-high-level-architecture-of-the-typescript-compiler)
- [JavaScript scope, Closures, and the TypeScript compiler](https://iamtk.co/javascript-scope-closures-and-the-typescript-compiler)

And now, in this post, I will cover different features of the [mini-typescript](https://github.com/imteekay/mini-typescript) and how they are implemented. For the exercises I implemented in the project, I will write new articles in the following posts of the series.

Let's go!
