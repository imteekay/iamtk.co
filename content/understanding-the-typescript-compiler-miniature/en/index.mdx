As you may know, I've been studying compilers. A lot. For the past month, I've been learning more about the TypeScript compiler, reading its source code, and implementing some of the exercises from the [mini-typescript](https://github.com/imteekay/mini-typescript).

In this post, I want to cover some of my learnings while reading the TypeScript compiler miniature's source code and implementing the exercises.

I will divide this article into three parts and the following posts to cover everything in this series.

- High level overview of the TypeScript compiler
- How closures are used in the compiler
- About different features of the [mini-typescript](https://github.com/imteekay/mini-typescript) and they are implemented
- The exercises I implemented in the following posts

Let's go!
