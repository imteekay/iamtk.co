This is my [Booklist of 2023](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/42505327).

This is by far the year that I read most books. Before sharing all 60 books, I want to state that my rating system is based on my own opinions and the ones that resonate the most with me at the time.

The two I loved the most were _The Emperor of All Maladies_ and _[What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](/bookshelf/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running)_. The first one is a masterpiece. It talks about cancer, science, research, history, and so much information about the world of medicine and science in its almost 600 pages. The second is a memoir of Haruki Murakami which he talks about his feelings when running and the challenges he faced. But what I liked the most in his book was how courageous he was to close his bar business to focus entirely on his novels and produce world-class books.

Here are some statistics:

- 51 of the books were non-fiction (the genre I like the most). So only 15% were fiction, and this includes 7 books of Harry. I'm actually pretty proud to finally read the entire saga.
- 76% were male authors. 24% female. Maybe it's time to diversify my reading and get a wider perspective. I'm in search of great female writers, some of I already found [here](https://triketora.com/2023/01/07/2022-booklist/), thanks Triketora.
- 8 biographies. I really this genre and I want to invest more time in it.
- Most of the books were self-help books, most what I would consider 3 stars or worse, and they didn't provide me great value, so for me, it would be much better to do something else or read more interesting books
