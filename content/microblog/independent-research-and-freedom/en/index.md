I keep debating with myself what I want to do in my life. What's the next step. "Freedom" is one of the words that come to my mind. Freedom to be wherever I want. Freedom to do whaterver I want. And I started to imagine myself studying, learning, and sharing for a living. Doing a PhD is a possibility in the future but not for now. Independent research is one of the greater possibilities I have for now and my eyes light up when I think about it. I started three main projects: <a href="https://github.com/imteekay/web-performance-research">web performance</a>, <a href="https://github.com/imteekay/frontend-infrastructure">frontend infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/imteekay/programming-language-theory">programming language theory</a>. Still figuring out how to push it forward in my life and how to do things. I truly want to make this works and I'll keep you up to date!
