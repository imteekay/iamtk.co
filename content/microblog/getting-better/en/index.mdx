You're not gonna get better by doing things that are easy, this is why I want to take the hard way, that's when you build the character, that's when you become resilient, is going through tough times.

Comfort is good. But constant comfort is not what I'm looking for. I want the next step. I want to become better. Tiny improvements every single day.
