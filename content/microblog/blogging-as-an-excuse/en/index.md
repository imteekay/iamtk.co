The process of writing is so fun. But I think it's not the writing part that I find most interesting.

Yes, writing is fun too, but the most interesting part for me is the research, learning, taking notes, getting data, reflecting on the topics, doing a lot of drafts, and then, writing the actual article.

I guess I use writing as an excuse (or a tool) to learn and think.
