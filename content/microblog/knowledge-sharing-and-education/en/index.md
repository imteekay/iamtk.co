One of the things that I want to keep doing in my life is knowledge sharing. The ability to share any experience, learnings, or failures that I had in the past. Knowledge and education are the way to keep evolving our society and I want to be part of this. When I get older, I want to look back and see everything I've done to contribute to this goal and leave my legacy for future generations.
