A couple of months ago, I wrote about [building a neural network from scratch with only Python and Mathematics](/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch-with-mathematics-and-python). Because I'm learning basic machine learning algorithms again, I decided to do a similar project and build a linear regression from scratch with Python and Mathematics.

Here are the topics of this article:

- How to represent the model
- The cost function: minimizing to optimize predictions
- Gradient descent: parameters optimization
- Vectorization: speed up the process
- Multiple variable linear regression

Let's start.

## Model Representation

The motivating example we'll use is a house price prediction problem. To make it very simple at the beginning, we'll use a dataset of only 2 examples with one feature (house size) and the target (price).

| Size (1000 sqft) | Price (1000s of dollars) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1.0              | 300                      |
| 2.0              | 500                      |
