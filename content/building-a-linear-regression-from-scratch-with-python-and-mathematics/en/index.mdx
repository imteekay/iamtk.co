A couple of months ago, I wrote about [building a neural network from scratch with only Python and Mathematics](/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch-with-mathematics-and-python). Because I'm learning basic machine learning algorithms again, I decided to do a similar project and build a linear regression from scratch with Python and Mathematics.

Here are the topics of this article:

- How to represent the model
- The cost function: minimizing to optimize predictions
- Gradient descent: parameters optimization
- Vectorization: speed up the process
- Multiple variable linear regression

Let's start.
