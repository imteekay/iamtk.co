## Point of discomfort & Failure

> “Do something that makes you uncomfortable every day. Get out of your comfort zone.” - David Goggins

Seeking discomfort to learn more and grow is one of the things I'm thinking about a lot these days. And what's the most uncomfortable environment if not moving abroad, changing jobs, learning a new language, and embracing a new culture at the same time?

I keep asking myself which one is riskier: to do and fail or not to do and have regret?

As Kobe Bryant said, [failure doesn't exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js8OfeEL4jI&ab_channel=MykChiz). If you "fail" Monday, try Tuesday. If you "fail" Tuesday, try Wednesday. I want to keep going, keep growing, and [enable myself to understand more about the world (and about myself)](/designing-my-lifes-system).

I usually have two different pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. And I want to always consciously choose the pain of discipline.

I have a lot of plans for my life, experiences I want to have, and things I want to learn. [I don't see myself settling down on things I know](https://twitter.com/wordsofteekay/status/1443936035105292288), and I want to use this intellectual vitality to get to know everything. With no priority in mind:

- _Photography_: I can't wait to take photos of the beautiful city of Tokyo.
- _Filmography_: I've been studying it and it's fascinating the art of capturing feelings and behavior. I see myself doing long-format videos/documentaries about things I find interesting.
- _Books_: I keep [collecting books](https://www.goodreads.com/iamteekay) to help me understand the world.
- _Traveling_: embracing the culture won't happen in my apartment. I want to travel as much as possible and get to know the beautiful places in the world, meet new people.
- _Writing_: I've been blogging for 7 years now. But mostly about programming. I want to expand the topics and write about other things I find interesting like, culture, languages, travel.
- _Tech_: I was in backend, fullstack, and frontend roles. I want to have time (and energy) to learn more about system programming and data science. I'm also doing [independent research on web performance](https://github.com/imteekay/web-performance-research), [web development](https://github.com/imteekay/webdev-research), and [devtools](https://github.com/imteekay/devtools-research).

Well, I think I have a lot of things to do and my life is just starting. I'm pretty excited about the future and my journey to become the version of myself.
