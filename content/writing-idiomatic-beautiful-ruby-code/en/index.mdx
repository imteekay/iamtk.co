Ruby is a beautiful programming language.

According to [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)’s official web page, Ruby is a:

> “dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.”

Ruby was created by [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz), a Japanese software engineer. Since 2011, he has been the chief designer & software engineer for Ruby at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Matsumoto has often said that he tries **to make Ruby natural, not simple**, in a way that mirrors life.

> “Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body” — Yukihiro Matsumoto

I feel the same way about Ruby. It is a complex but very natural programming language, with a beautiful and intuitive syntax.

With more intuitive and faster code, we are able to build better software. In this post, I will show you how I express my thoughts (aka code) with Ruby, by using snippets of code.

### Expressing my thoughts with array methods

#### Map

Use the **map** method to simplify your code and get what you want.

The method **map** returns a new array with the results of running a block once for every element in enum.

Let’s try it:

```ruby
an_array.map { |element| element * element }
```

Simple as that.

But when you begin coding with Ruby, it is easy to always use the **each** iterator.

The **each** iterator as shown below

```ruby
user_ids = []
users.each { |user| user_ids << user.id }
```

Can be simplified with **map** in a single beautiful line of code:

```ruby
user_ids = users.map { |user| user.id }
```

Or even better (and faster):

```ruby
user_ids = users.map(&:id)
```

#### Select

And when you’re used to coding with **map**, sometimes your code can be like this:

```ruby
even_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map { |element| element if element.even? } # [ni, 2, nil, 4, nil]
even_numbers = even_numbers.compact # [2, 4]
```

**nil** object as well. Use the **compact** method to remove all **nil** objects.

And ta-da, you’ve selected all the even numbers.

Mission accomplished.

Come on, we can do better than this! Did you hear about the **select** method from enumerable module?

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].select { |element| element.even? }
```

Just one line. Simple code. Easy to understand.

#### Bonus

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].select(&:even?)
```

#### Sample

Imagine that you need to get a random element from an array. You just started learning Ruby, so your first thought will be, “Let’s use the **random** method,” and that’s what happens:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3][rand(3)]
```

Well, we can understand the code, but I’m not sure if it is good enough. And what if we use the **shuffle** method?

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].shuffle.first
```

Hmm. I actually prefer to use **shuffle** over **rand**. But when I discovered the **sample** method, it made so much more sense:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].sample
```

Really, really simple.

Pretty natural and intuitive. We ask a **sample** from an array and the method returns it. Now I’m happy.

What about you?

### Expressing my thoughts with Ruby syntax

As I mentioned before, I love the way Ruby lets me code. It’s really natural for me. I’ll show parts of the beautiful Ruby syntax.

#### Implicit return

Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. A simple example is the **getter **method. We call a method and expect some value in return.

Let’s see:

```ruby
def get_user_ids(users)
  return users.map(&:id)
end

```

But as we know, Ruby always returns the last evaluated expression. Why use the **return** statement?

```ruby
def get_user_ids(users)
  users.map(&:id)
end

```

After using Ruby for 3 years, I feel great using almost every method without the **return** statement.

#### Multiple assignments

Ruby allows me to assign multiple variables at the same time. When you begin, you may be coding like this:

```ruby
def values
  [1, 2, 3]
end

one   = values[0]
two   = values[1]
three = values[2]
```

But why not assign multiple variables at the same time?

```ruby
def values
  [1, 2, 3]
end

one, two, three = values

```

Pretty awesome.

#### Methods that ask questions (also called predicates)

One feature that caught my attention when I was learning Ruby was the **question mark (?)** method, also called the **predicates **methods. It was weird to see at first, but now it makes so much sense. You can write code like this:

```ruby
movie.awesome # => true
```

Ok… nothing wrong with that. But let’s use the question mark:

```ruby
movie.awesome? # => true
```

This code is much more expressive, and I expect the method’s answer to return either a **true** or **false** value.

A method that I commonly use is **any?** It’s like asking an array if it has **any**thing inside it.

```ruby
[].any? # => false
[1, 2, 3].any? # => true

```

#### Interpolation

For me string interpolation is more intuitive than string concatenation. Period. Let’s see it in action.

An example of a string concatenation:

```ruby
programming_language = "Ruby"
programming_language + " is a beautiful programming_language" # => "Ruby is a beautiful programming_language"
```

An example of a string interpolation:

```ruby
programming_language = "Ruby"
"#{programming_language} is a beautiful programming_language" # => "Ruby is a beautiful programming_language"
```

I prefer string interpolation.

What do you think?

#### The if statement

I like to use the **if** statement:

```ruby
def hey_ho?
  true
end

puts "let’s go" if hey_ho?
```

Pretty nice to code like that.

Feels really natural.

#### The try method (with Rails mode on)

The **try** method invokes the method identified by the symbol, passing it any arguments and/or the block specified. This is similar to Ruby’s **Object#send.** Unlike that method, **nil** will be returned if the receiving object is a **nil** object or **NilClass.**

Using **if and unless** condition statement:

```ruby
user.id unless user.nil?
```

Using the **try **method:

```ruby
user.try(:id)
```

Since Ruby 2.3, we can use Ruby’s safe navigation operator** (&.)** instead of Rails **try **method.

```ruby
user&.id
```

#### Double pipe equals (||=) / memoization

This feature is so C-O-O-L. It’s like caching a value in a variable.

```ruby
some_variable ||= 10
puts some_variable # => 10

some_variable ||= 99
puts some_variable # => 10

```

You don’t need to use the **if** statement ever. Just use double pipe equals **(||=)** and it’s done.

Simple and easy.

#### Class static method

One way I like to write Ruby classes is to define a **static **method (class method).

```ruby
GetSearchResult.call(params)
```

Simple. Beautiful. Intuitive.

What happens in the background?

```ruby
class GetSearchResult
  def self.call(params)
    new(params).call
  end

  def initialize(params)
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    # ... your code here ...
  end
end

```

The **self.call** method initializes an instance, and this object calls the **call **method. [Interactor design pattern](https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor) uses it.

#### Getters and setters

For the same **GetSearchResult** class, if we want to use the params, we can use the @params

```ruby
class GetSearchResult
  def self.call(params)
    new(params).call
  end

  def initialize(params)
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    # ... your code here ...
    @params # do something with @params
  end
end

```

We define a **setter **and **getter:**

```ruby
class GetSearchResult
  def self.call(params)
    new(params).call
  end

  def initialize(params)
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    # ... your code here ...
    params # do something with params method here
  end

  private

  def params
    @params
  end

  def params=(parameters)
    @params = parameters
  end
end

```

Or we can define **attr_reader**, **attr_writer,** or **attr_accessor**

```ruby
class GetSearchResult
  attr_reader :param

  def self.call(params)
    new(params).call
  end

  def initialize(params)
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    # ... your code here ...
    params # do something with params method here
  end
end

```

Nice.

We don’t need to define the **getter** and **setter** methods. The code just became simpler, just what we want.

#### Tap

Imagine you want to define a **create_user** method. This method will instantiate, set the parameters, and save and return the user.

Let’s do it.

```ruby
def create_user(params)
  user       = User.new
  user.id    = params[:id]
  user.name  = params[:name]
  user.email = params[:email]
  # ...
  user.save
  user
end
```

Simple. Nothing wrong here.

So now let’s implement it with the **tap** method

```ruby
def create_user(params)
  User.new.tap do |user|
    user.id    = params[:id]
    user.name  = params[:name]
    user.email = params[:email]
    # ...
    user.save
  end
end
```

You just need to worry about the user parameters, and the **tap** method will return the user object for you.

### That’s it

We learned I write idiomatic Ruby by coding with

- array methods

- syntax

We also learned how Ruby is beautiful and intuitive, and runs even faster.
