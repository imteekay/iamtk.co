This is part of my series on [Elixir Learnings](/series/elixir-learnings), where I share micro-posts about everything I'm learning related to Elixir.

Today we going to play around with lists. At the same time lists are very simple, they are powerful. And we use it always in our day-to-day work. Here we will understand some common concepts we need to handle lists.

## Add and remove items

We have two ways to add new items to the list. We can use the `insert_at` List function and the `++` operator to concat lists.

The `insert_at` function receives three parameters: the list, the index position you want to add the new item, and the item.

```ruby
items = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4]
List.insert_at(items, 0, 0) # [0, 1 ,2 ,3 ,4]
List.insert_at(items, 4, 5) # [1 ,2 ,3 ,4, 5]
```

And Elixir lists are immutable. After these operations, if we call the `items` again, it will be the first value.

```ruby
items # [1 ,2 ,3 ,4]
```

The list value doesn't change.

We can also use the `++` operator to concat lists to add a new item.

```ruby
brothers = ['TK', 'Yuji', 'Bruno']
new_brother = 'Kaio'
brothers ++ [new_brother] # ['TK', 'Yuji', 'Bruno', 'Kaio']
```

Not only one item. But concat any list.

```ruby
['TK', 'Kaio'] ++ ['Yuji', 'Bruno'] # ['TK', 'Kaio', 'Yuji', 'Bruno']
```

With the `--` operator, we can subtract a list of items from the left list.

```ruby
bookshelf = ['HP', 'Compound Effect', 'Enlightenment Now']
bookshelf -- ['HP'] # ['Compound Effect', 'Enlightenment Now']
```

## Getting items

I learned simple but very useful functions to get items: `first` and `last`.

```ruby
List.first([1, 2, 3]) # 1
List.last([1, 2, 3]) # 3
```

We can also handle empty lists:

```ruby
List.first([]) # nil
List.last([]) # nil
```

## Make it flat

Another cool function is `flat`. It flats nested lists. In other words, it transforms nested lists into just one with all the elements.

- Not so nested lists

```ruby
List.flatten([1, [2], [3]]) # [1, 2, 3]
```

- More complex nested lists

```ruby
List.flatten([1, [[2, [3]]]]) # [1, 2, 3]
```

- Nested empty lists

```ruby
List.flatten([[], [[], []]]) # []
```

## Iterate through it

One thing we always do with lists is iteration. We can use the `each` function from the `Enum` module to loop through the list.

```ruby
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Enum.each(items, fn (n) -> IO.inspect(n) end)
```

And we can also use a shortcut for functions.

```ruby
Enum.each(items, &IO.inspect/1) # shortcut
```

The `Enum` module has various other functions to work on data types, like lists, that implements the `Enumerable` protocol.

## Destructuring

Another way to get items from the list is called `destructuring`. We unpack items from the list by specifying the "variables" inside a list.

```ruby
[a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3]
IO.inspect a
IO.inspect b
IO.inspect c
```

With the `[a, b, c]`, we are specifying the variable names to destructure the list.

If you want to get only the second item, use the `_` operator (also called `wildcard`).

```ruby
[_, x, _] = [1, 2, 3]
IO.inspect x # 2
```

Another interesting way to get items is by using the `|` operator. With this operator, we get the head (first item) and the right part represents the other items.

```ruby
[head | rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
IO.inspect head # 1
IO.inspect rest # [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

But it's not just about the first element. We can specify more than just the first item.

```ruby
[first, second | rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
IO.inspect first # 1
IO.inspect second # 2
IO.inspect rest # [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Lists are linked lists in Elixir. The last node points to an empty list.

```ruby
[head | rest] = [:a]
IO.inspect head # :a
IO.inspect rest # []
```

This is why when we get the rest, it is an empty list.

## Wrapping up

Lists have the `wrap` function to transform values into a list. It wraps the value in a list.

```ruby
List.wrap("TK") # ["TK"]
List.wrap(1) # [1]
List.wrap(true) # [true]
List.wrap(:ola) # [:ola]
```

We can also wrap a list. But it just returns the same list.

```ruby
List.wrap([1, 2, 3]) # [1, 2, 3]
```

`nil` is also a value. It represents the absence of a value. When we wrap it, the function returns an empty list.

```ruby
List.wrap(nil) # []
```
