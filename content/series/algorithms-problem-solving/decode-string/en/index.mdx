## Problem description

This is the [Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/) problem. The description looks like this:

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

Constraints**:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 30`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets `'[]'`.
- `s` is guaranteed to be **a valid** input.
- All the integers in `s` are in the range `[1, 300]`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```bash
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```

**Example 3:**

```bash
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```

## Solution

One of the possible solutions I came up with was to use a [stack data structure](/series/data-structures/stack-data-structure) to handle the data within the brackets. The basic idea is to iterate through all characters for each character, verify if it's a number, a `]` (closing bracket), or a normal string character (`[` included).

To iterate through the entire string, we can use a `while` with an index:

```tsx
while (index < encodedString.length) {
  index++;
}
```

To verify if the character is a number, I built a simple function:

```tsx
const isNum = (char) => !isNaN(Number(char));
```

So if the character is a number, we push it to the stack. But the number can be more than just one digit, so we need to move to the next index until the character isn’t a number anymore.

```tsx
if (isNum(char)) {
  const number = [];

  while (isNum(encodedString[index])) {
    number.push(encodedString[index]);
    index++;
  }

  stack.push(Number(number.join('')));
  continue;
}
```

I created a `number` array and push each number character into this list. After we get the whole number, we push it to the stack.

But if the character is a `]`, we need to get the whole string that was inside the brackets and we do it by using the `pop` method from the stack. We do it until it gets to the `[` character. Then we can `pop` it again to remove the `[` character. And finally, repeat the string x times and push it to the stack.

```tsx
if (char === ']') {
  let str = '';

  while (stack[stack.length - 1] !== '[') {
    str = stack.pop() + str;
  }

  stack.pop();
  stack.push(str.repeat(stack.pop()));
  index++;
  continue;
}
```

The `repeat` method is very interesting. I didn’t know about this method, so I usually do a loop that works fine too:

```tsx
const repeatedString = [];
const str = 'hey';
let num = 3;

while (num > 0) {
  repeatedString.push(str);
  num--;
}

repeatedString.join(''); // 'heyheyhey'
```

Using repeat is so much simpler and more convenient for this problem.

```tsx
const str = 'hey';
const num = 3;

str.repeat(num); // 'heyheyhey'
```

And finally, if it isn't a `]` and number, just push the character to the stack and increment the index:

```tsx
stack.push(char);
index++;
```

The whole implementation looks like this:

```tsx
const isNum = (char) => !isNaN(Number(char));

function decodeString(encodedString) {
  const stack = [];
  let index = 0;

  while (index < encodedString.length) {
    const char = encodedString[index];

    if (isNum(char)) {
      const number = [];

      while (isNum(encodedString[index])) {
        number.push(encodedString[index]);
        index++;
      }

      stack.push(Number(number.join('')));
      continue;
    }

    if (char === ']') {
      let str = '';

      while (stack[stack.length - 1] !== '[') {
        str = stack.pop() + str;
      }

      stack.pop();
      stack.push(str.repeat(stack.pop()));
      index++;
      continue;
    }

    stack.push(char);
    index++;
  }

  return stack.join('');
}
```
