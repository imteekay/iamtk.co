## Problem description

This is the **[Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/description/)** problem. The description looks like this:

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert *it to a **height-balanced** binary search tree*.

A **height-balanced** binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Examples

Example 1:

```bash
Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
```

Example 2:

```bash
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
```

Example 3:

```bash
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
```

## Solution

To construct a height-balanced binary search tree, we can break down the array into the middle, create a new node based on the middle number, go to the left, do the same process, go to the right, and also do the same process.

This picture illustrates the process:

1. go to the middle
2. create a new node based on this middle number
3. go to the left

   3.1. cut the array from the start to the middle - 1<br />
   3.2. create a new node based on this middle number<br />
   3.3. go to the right and the left

4. go to the right

   4.1. cut the array from the middle + 1 to the end<br />
   4.2. create a new node based on this middle number<br />
   4.3. go to the right and the left

You can see that the third and forth steps we can implement by recursively call the function. We just need to adjust the data structure.

```javascript
function sortedArrayToBST(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return null;

  const middle = Math.floor(nums.length / 2);
  const num = nums[middle];
  const node = new TreeNode(num);

  node.left = sortedArrayToBST(nums.slice(0, middle));
  node.right = sortedArrayToBST(nums.slice(middle + 1, nums.length));

  return node;
}
```

And this is the generated binary search tree with balanced height:
