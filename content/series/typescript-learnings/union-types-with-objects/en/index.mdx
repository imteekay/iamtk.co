This post is part of the [Typescript Learning Series](/series/typescript-learnings).

When I was testing some ideas and API features for JavaScript dates, I built a project in Typescript. I wanted to build a more [human-friendly API to handle dates](/fun-with-dates).

This is what I was looking for:

```tsx
get(1).dayAgo; // it gets yesterday
```

I also make it work for month and year:

```tsx
get(1).monthAgo; // it gets a month ago from today
get(1).yearAgo; // it gets a year ago from today
```

These are great! But I wanted more: what if we want to get days, months, or years ago? It works too:

```tsx
get(30).daysAgo;
get(6).monthsAgo;
get(10).yearsAgo;
```

And about the implementation? It is just a function that returns an JavaScript object:

```tsx
const get = (n: number): DateAgo | DatesAgo => {
  if (n < 1) {
    throw new Error('Number should be greater or equal than 1');
  }

  const { day, month, year }: SeparatedDate = getSeparatedDate();

  const dayAgo: Date = new Date(year, month, day - n);
  const monthAgo: Date = new Date(year, month - n, day);
  const yearAgo: Date = new Date(year - n, month, day);

  const daysAgo: Date = new Date(year, month, day - n);
  const monthsAgo: Date = new Date(year, month - n, day);
  const yearsAgo: Date = new Date(year - n, month, day);

  if (n > 1) {
    return { daysAgo, monthsAgo, yearsAgo };
  }

  return { dayAgo, monthAgo, yearAgo };
};
```

And here we are! I want to tell you about Union Type with objects.

We have different return types depending on the `n` parameter. If the `n` is greater than `1`, we return an object with "plural" kind of attributes. Otherwise, I just return the "singular" type of attributes.

Different return types. So I built the two types.

The `DateAgo`:

```tsx
type DateAgo = {
  dayAgo: Date;
  monthAgo: Date;
  yearAgo: Date;
};
```

And the `DatesAgo`:

```tsx
type DatesAgo = {
  daysAgo: Date;
  monthsAgo: Date;
  yearsAgo: Date;
};
```

And use them in the function definition:

```tsx
const get = (n: number): DateAgo | DatesAgo =>
```

But this gets a type error.

When using:

```tsx
get(2).daysAgo;
```

I got this error: `Property 'daysAgo' does not exist on type 'DateAgo | DatesAgo'.`

When using:

```tsx
get(1).dayAgo;
```

I got this error: `Property 'dayAgo' does not exist on type 'DateAgo | DatesAgo'.`

The `DateAgo` doesn't declare the following types:

- `daysAgo`
- `monthsAgo`
- `yearsAgo`

The same for the `DatesAgo`:

- `dayAgo`
- `monthAgo`
- `yearAgo`

But it can have this properties in run-time. Because we can assign any kind of properties to an object. So a possible solution would be to add an `undefined` type to both `DateAgo` and `DatesAgo`.

```tsx
type DateAgo = {
  dayAgo: Date;
  monthAgo: Date;
  yearAgo: Date;
  daysAgo: undefined;
  monthsAgo: undefined;
  yearsAgo: undefined;
};

type DatesAgo = {
  daysAgo: Date;
  monthsAgo: Date;
  yearsAgo: Date;
  dayAgo: undefined;
  monthAgo: undefined;
  yearAgo: undefined;
};
```

This will fix the issue in compile time. But with this, you'll always need to set an `undefined` value to the object. One to get around this is to add an optional to the `undefined` types. Like this:

```tsx
yearAgo?: undefined
```

With that, you can set these `undefined` properties. A better solution is to use the `never` type:

> "The never type represents the type of values that never occur."

```tsx
type DateAgo = {
  dayAgo: Date;
  monthAgo: Date;
  yearAgo: Date;
  daysAgo?: never;
  monthsAgo?: never;
  yearsAgo?: never;
};

type DatesAgo = {
  daysAgo: Date;
  monthsAgo: Date;
  yearsAgo: Date;
  dayAgo?: never;
  monthAgo?: never;
  yearAgo?: never;
};
```

It works as expected and it also represents the data semantically as these attributes will not occur for both situations.
