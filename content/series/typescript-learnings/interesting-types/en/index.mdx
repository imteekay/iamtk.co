These days I'm building a new project to understand some topics deeply. It is about user experience, web performance, accessibility, and a type system for consistent data.

This project I'm basically using React with Typescript. At first, I implemented a custom hook to handle the data fetching. One of the possible data types the fetch could return is a `Product` type. It looks like this:

```typescript
type Product = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  imageUrl: string;
  description: string;
  isShippingFree: boolean;
  discount: number;
};
```

Now that I could fetch some products, I wanted to use the list of products to render in the DOM. So I created a `Product` component. But as we are using Typescript, the props should be typed. In this case, I used the `Product` type. It looks like this:

```typescript
export const Product = ({
  imageUrl,
  name,
  description,
  price,
  discount,
  isShippingFree,
}: ProductType) => (
  <Box>
    <Image imageUrl={imageUrl} imageAlt={name} />
    <TitleDescription name={name} description={description} />
    <Price price={price} discount={discount} />
    <Tag label="Free Shipping" isVisible={isShippingFree} />
  </Box>
);
```

And when I started implementing the `Image` component, I just passed the `imageUrl` and the `imageAlt` as props. It looks like this:

```typescript
export const Image = ({ imageUrl }) => <img src={imageUrl} />;
```

In this case, I couldn't use the `Product` type. But I could reuse it.

I learned about this new type: the [Partial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialt) type. The idea of the `Partial` type is to build a new type based on the passed type and set all attributes to `optional`.

So, if we do a partial of the `Product` type, it would look like this:

```typescript
type Product = {
  name?: string;
  price?: number;
  imageUrl?: string;
  description?: string;
  isShippingFree?: boolean;
  discount?: number;
};
```

All properties are set to optional.

And now I can use it for the `Image` component:

```typescript
export const Image = ({ imageUrl }): Partial<ProductType> => (
  <img src={imageUrl} />
);
```

But when I use the `Image` component, I can pass any props I want. I miss the type check. It doesn't break in compile time.

To fix that, I could just build an `ImagePropsType` and use it as the component props type.

```typescript
type ImagePropsType = {
  imageUrl: string;
};

export const Image = ({ imageUrl }): ImagePropsType => <img src={imageUrl} />;
```

But I already have the type for the `imageUrl` inside the `Product` type. So I started to search how I could reuse the type: I found the `Pick` type.

The `Pick` type lets me reuse the `Product` type by picking a set of properties I want:

```typescript
type ImagePropsType = Pick<ProductType, 'imageUrl'>;
```

Now I ensure that type checking and the type reusability work well.

To build the whole `Image` component, I also needed to pass other props like: `imageAlt` and `width`.

What I wanted is the intersection of the `Pick<ProductType, 'imageUrl'>`, the `imageAlt` type, and the `width` type.

In Typescript, the representation of the intersection is the `&` operator.

I defined the `ImageUrlType`:

```typescript
type ImageUrlType = Pick<ProductType, 'imageUrl'>;
```

And the `ImageAttrType` to represent both the `imageAlt` and the `width`:

```typescript
type ImageAttrType = { imageAlt: string; width?: string };
```

And compose them together by insecting the types:

```typescript
type ImagePropsType = ImageUrlType & ImageAttrType;
```

And the final result is:

```typescript
import { ProductType } from 'types/Product';

type ImageUrlType = Pick<ProductType, 'imageUrl'>;
type ImageAttrType = { imageAlt: string; width?: string };
type ImagePropsType = ImageUrlType & ImageAttrType;

export const Image = ({ imageUrl, imageAlt, width }: ImagePropsType) => (
  <img src={imageUrl} alt={imageAlt} width={width} />
);
```

I have the image URL, alt, width types intersected, and defined in the `ImagePropsType`. It can think of types as data and compose them. This is a very cool feature.

These are the interesting new types I learned this week.
