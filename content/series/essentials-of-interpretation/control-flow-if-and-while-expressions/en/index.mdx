These notes were taken from the [Essentials of Interpretation](https://dmitrysoshnikov.teachable.com/p/essentials-of-interpretation) course by [Dmitry Soshnikov](https://dmitrysoshnikov.teachable.com/) and part of the [Essentials of Interpretation series](/series/essentials-of-interpretation).

In the [previous post](/series/essentials-of-interpretation/variables-environments-and-blocks), we talked about variables, environments, blocks and how they handle scoping in a programming language. In this post, we'll take a look at control flow, more especifically, if and while expressions.

## If Expressions: handling conditions

To better understand how to approach if expressions, let's take a look at their structure and syntax.

```jsx
(if <condition>
    <consequent>
    <alternate>)
```

We have the `if` expression, the condition, if the condition evaluates to `true`, it goes to the first branch, the `consequent`, if it's `false`, it goes to the `alternate` branch.

Starting with tests, here's a simple expression that's easy to understand.

```jsx
test(
  eva,
  `(begin
    (var x 10)
    (var y 0)
    (if (> x 10)
      (set y 20)
      (set y 30))
    y)`,
  30,
);
```

We define the variables `x` and `y`. If the `x` is greater than `10`, it will assign `20` to `y`, if not, it will assign `30`. In this case, `x` is equal to `10`, so `y` will be `30` at the end of this code block.

Let's go for the implementation now. When we have an if expression, it requires us to get all the parts of it: the tag name, the condition, the consequent, and the alternate. Here it is:

```jsx
if (exp[0] === 'if') {
  const [_tag, condition, consequent, alternate] = exp;
  // ...
}
```

The rest of the implementation is pretty simple. First, we need to evaluate the condition. If it evaluates to `true`, we return the evaluation of the `consequent` expression. If it evaluates to `false`, we should return the evaluation of the `alternate` expression.

```jsx
if (exp[0] === 'if') {
  const [_tag, condition, consequent, alternate] = exp;
  return this.eval(condition, env)
    ? this.eval(consequent, env)
    : this.eval(alternate, env);
}
```

But executing it still doesn't work as we are still required to implement the comparison operators.

As we learned in the [previous post about global vs local scope and environments](https://www.iamtk.co/series/essentials-of-interpretation/variables-environments-and-blocks), we can add all the comparison operators as built-in expressions of the language. That way, we don't actually need to parse and evaluate them.

```jsx
const GlobalEnvironment = new Environment({
  // ...

  '>': (op1, op2) => {
    return op1 > op2;
  },

  '<': (op1, op2) => {
    return op1 < op2;
  },

  '<=': (op1, op2) => {
    return op1 <= op2;
  },

  '>=': (op1, op2) => {
    return op1 >= op2;
  },

  '=': (op1, op2) => {
    return op1 === op2;
  },

  // ...
});
```

Now, it passes the check when running the test.

Just to make sure all comparison operators work, I added more tests to cover them all.

```jsx
test(
  eva,
  `(begin
    (if (>= 10 10)
      1
      2))`,
  1,
);

test(
  eva,
  `(begin
    (if (<= 10 10)
      1
      2))`,
  1,
);

test(
  eva,
  `(begin
    (if (= 10 10)
      1
      2))`,
  1,
);

test(
  eva,
  `(begin
    (if (< 10 10)
      1
      2))`,
  2,
);
```

## While Expressions: looping

The structure of while expressions reminds me a lot of if expressions. But it doesn't have the `consequent` and `alternate` part, it has only a body of expressions.

Let's start with the test:

```jsx
test(
  eva,
  `(begin
    (var counter 0)
    (var result 0)
    
    (while (< counter 10)
      (begin
        (set counter (+ counter 1))
        (set result (+ result 1))))
        
    result)`,
  10,
);
```

We start with a `counter` and a `result` as `0`. For every loop, it will increment the counter and the result. When the counter reaches `10` or more than `10`, it will stop the loop.

In this case, it will stop when the `counter` and the `result` are `10`. So the whole block of code will evaluate to `10`.

Hereâ€™s the implementation:

```jsx
if (exp[0] === 'while') {
  const [_, condition, body] = exp;
  let result;

  while (this.eval(condition, env)) {
    result = this.eval(body, env);
  }

  return result;
}
```

We get the `condition` and the `body`.

We'll keep evaluating the `condition` while it keeps being evaluated to `true`. For every loop, it will evaluate the `body` and the value produced in this process will be stored in the `result` variable.

That way, the last time it evaluates the body will be the value we want to return from this while expression.

Running the tests again, it passes.

## Final words
