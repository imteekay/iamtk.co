I'm currently working on an almost-5-year-old codebase, so you can probably imagine the complexities, the number of features, and the number of engineers who have worked on it.

Thanks to my colleagues, we have a very healthy codebase. But we saw a lot of potential for improvements. This was collected from an internal engineering survey.

When growing complexities and features on a codebase, it gets really easy to have performance regressions if you are not focused on that.

When I started working on this codebase, I also saw a lot of potentials when it comes to web performance. I started [profiling and optimizing some runtime performance issues](/profiling-and-optimizing-the-runtime-performance-with-the-devtools-performance-tab). Seeing core web vitals metrics and the final webpack bundle, it was easy to understand some problems.

In this case study, I want to show one part of the strategies I'm taking to optimize the performance of this product. As code splitting is the topic of this article, in this case study, I will cover code splitting related optimizations only. But there are many other things on the roadmap to improve and I can talk more about them in a future post.

The optimizations done are for:

- **Code splitting — by page**: search, home, account, membership, and other pages
- **Code splitting — below the fold**: footer
- **Code splitting — conditional content**: login dialog, hotel details overlay

### Code splitting by page

Some of the pages were not code split so it was an easy win to separate them into their own bundle and serve it only when they are in need. No more home-related code being downloaded when the user reaches the search page, and vice versa, and for other pages too.

All the pages that needed code splitting were the home, search, account, membership, and some other places but not much difference in the final bundle.

As we already talked about in this post, I just needed to create loadables and use them in each route. Simple as that.

### Below the fold code splitting

The footer is a section used in all packages, it can be code split and this chunk would be downloaded only when the user scrolls down the page and reach the end of the page.

Using the _intersection observer_, we can track if the user reached the end of the page the same way explained here.

<img

  class="round"
  loading="lazy"
/>

Another great benefit is caching. After the first download, the new separate chunk is cached in the browser, so every time the user goes to another page that uses the footer, it’s already cached in the browser and it doesn’t need to download again.

### Conditional content code splitting

<div class="text-img-side-by-side">
  <div>
    The most impactful result I had was code splitting the login dialog. This
    component is only shown to guest users (unlogged users) who click on the
    login button to open it.

    This code split reduced the bundle by ~126.81 KB, gzipped. It is a huge
    component because it handles a lot of cases: sign up, sign in, and the
    unlocking flow.

    For the authenticated users, it's even better because they don't need to
    download this whole component again.

  </div>
  <img
    src="/web-performance-code-splitting-strategies-and-react-applications/login-dialog.png"
    class="round"
    loading="lazy"
  />
</div>

I used the very same strategy for all other conditional content that we show to the user on the search page.

It includes components like the **hotel details overlay** (it's shown when the user clicks the hotel card), the **search filters popup** (it's shown when the user interacts with the search filters to select deals that fit their need), **language and currency selectors** (it's shown when the user needs to run the website in different currencies or language), and some other smaller components.

### Improvements and Results

Reduced `430.11 KB` in the final bundle. It is around ~30% less JavaScript we are shipping in the main bundle. Huge improvement. As I'm still running this experiment, I want to gather more data to have a clear view of the optimizations. But the metrics I'm focusing on are:

- Largest Contentful Paint / Loading time: tracking load time
- First Input Delay / Total Blocking Time: tracking user interactivity
- Business metrics: our custom engagement and conversion metrics

I can also look at other metrics here but this is a good start for these improvements. Let's see how it goes and I can update this article in the future.
