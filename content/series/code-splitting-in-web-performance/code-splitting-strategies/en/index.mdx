In this post, I want to talk about one of the techniques we can take to reduce JavaScript in the final bundle: Code splitting.

Code splitting is the process of splitting the bundle into multiple, smaller bundles (also known as JavaScript chunks).

But splitting into smaller bundles can have no effect on performance and UX improvements. We can use this technique together with some strategies to optimize web performance and improve the perceived performance from the user's perspective.

In this post, we'll talk about three of them: code splitting by page (or route), split below-the-fold code, and conditional content like modals, popups, side menus, etc.

### Code splitting: by page

Imagine you have a Home page and a Search page. Every time you load the Home page, the bundle will also contain code from the Search page. It's not ideal as we are making the user downloads JavaScript (and other assets) that are not necessary to render the Home page.

What if we could split the Home page into a `Home.js` bundle and the Search page into a `Search.js` bundle? This way we would load only the `Home.js` bundle when the user reaches the Home page. The same for the Search page and the `Search.js` bundle.

This is exactly what code splitting by page (or by route) is. We use routes as entry points to create new smaller bundles that will be served only when we need to serve them.

When you split your app's bundle into separate bundles by page, you are drastically reducing the size of your final bundle and you're serving only the necessary JavaScript per page.

In the illustrated image above, we can see that we potentially are reducing 3.5mb of JavaScript on the home page and 1.5mb on the search page. And that's a huge improvement!

Code splitting by page is pretty common and I would guess that most of the frontend engineers know about this strategy and use it in their favor to improve their app's performance and UX.

### Code splitting: below the fold

In the same idea as downloading only the necessary JavaScript, we want to use a strategy of splitting the bundle into an "above the fold" bundle and a "below the fold" bundle.

Imagine you are working on a landing page. The visible section after loading the page is showing the page header, the form, and a big hero image. We can call it the "above the fold" section. Everything that's not in this fold, it's "below the fold".

<img

  loading="lazy"
/>

The user doesn't care about the "below the fold" sections because the most important section in the _first load_ is the "above the fold" section. The strategy here is to split the "below the fold" sections into a new bundle and download this JavaScript when the user scrolls down and reaches this section.

How would you do it? The answer is pretty much using the Intersection Observer API. This API "provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport". We can use it to detect the visibility of a given element, in this case, the "below the fold" sections.

Imagine we wrap the "below the fold" sections into a div that has the id "below-the-fold". With the Intersection Observer API, we can make it observe this target element and when it's intersecting with the viewport, we make it download the new separate bundle.

```javascript
const callback = (entries, observer) => {
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    // entry.isIntersecting
  });
};

const options = { threshold: 1.0 };
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);
const target = document.querySelector('#below-the-fold');

observer.observe(target);
```

The API is pretty straightforward:

- `callback`: for each entry, we want to know if the target element is intersecting with the viewport
- `options`: the threshold represents the percentage of visibility of the target.
- `target`: the element we want to observe

With this code, we can pretty much download any new JavaScript bundle if the target element is intersecting with the viewport, and then reduce the app's bundle and download subsequent bundles on demand. That's powerful.

### Code splitting: conditional content

Again, we are still following the same concept here: loading only the necessary JavaScript code and splitting the other parts into separate smaller bundles.

Conditional content we can think of as side menus (doesn't appear in the first render), popups (like ads, promotional content, etc), or dialogs (like login dialogs if you click the login button).

<img
  class="full"
  src="/web-performance-code-splitting-strategies-and-react-applications/4.conditional-splitting.png"
  loading="lazy"
/>

We only want to download these JavaScripts if the condition evaluates to `true`. In the illustrated image above, we have `App.js`, `SideMenu.js`, `LoginDialog.js`, and `AdsPopup.js`. If not code split, the page would download 5mb but with the conditional code splitting strategy, we can reduce by ~40% the size of the JavaScript bundle (~2mb less JavaScript in this case). It would be a huge improvement in the load and execution time.

<img
  class="full"
  src="/web-performance-code-splitting-strategies-and-react-applications/5.conditional-splitting-flow.png"
  loading="lazy"
/>

In the first render, the app will only download, parse, compile and execute the `App.js` bundle, reducing it from 5mb to a total of 3mb. If the user clicks the side menu icon, it needs to download the `SideMenu.js` bundle to open it. The same thing for the `LoginDialog.js` and the `AdsPopup.js`.

We can see that we only download (parse, compile, and execute) the separate bundles on demand, when the user requires the app to have the code.

### Code splitting: browser caching

One of the cool things we get for free when we do code splitting is the browser caching capability. As you already know, when we do code splitting, we create a separate bundle and the browser downloads it, the bundle will be cached for further downloads.

To do this experiment, get your app now, or any other website you use, open the DevTools, and select the network tab.

Select the `JS` to filter only this type of file in the network tab list. Reload the page for the first time and you'll see all the JavaScript that's being downloaded. Reload the page one more time (not a hard reload, nor a "clean cache and reload") and you'll see the size of some of the JavaScript in the Devtools, and they don't show the size anymore. They show a `(disk cache)` text. If you hover over this text, it will show a tooltip saying `"Served from disk cache"`.

  src="/web-performance-code-splitting-strategies-and-react-applications/6.disk-cache.png"

/>

This caching strategy is nice to be used for the code splitting we talked about before, but also for other types of code splitting. One of the most common is code splitting big libraries or dependencies into their own separate bundle.

So, imagine that you like functional programming and you use `ramda`, you can code split this library into a new bundle. Every time a page needs this library, it will try to download this new bundle. After the first time, it will be cached in the browser, so if the user accesses the page again, it won't download the bundle anymore, it gets from the cache. The cost will be probably ~1ms/2ms.

This is interesting because the library can be used on different pages of the product and as it's already cached, it won't penalize the user again. We, engineers, don't bump libraries versions that often, so the probability of this library being cached for the users for a long time is very high.

If you apply this same strategy to a list of the biggest libraries in your codebase, it will save more time for recurrent users. I showed an example of this approach in a `React` application using `webpack` and the `CommonsChunkPlugin`: **[Optimizing the Performance of a React Progressive Web App — Caching Biggest Dependencies](/optimizing-the-performance-of-a-react-progressive-web-app#caching-biggest-dependencies).**
