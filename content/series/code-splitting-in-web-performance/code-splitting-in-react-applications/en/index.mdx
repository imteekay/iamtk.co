In React applications, we have different approaches to do code splitting. The most common ones are: using `React.lazy`, using `loadable-components`, and using `react-loadable`.

All three are very similar in syntax and the result is pretty much the same. Or [almost the same](https://loadable-components.com/docs/loadable-vs-react-lazy). I have used `react-loadable` before but it's not maintained anymore, so I won't focus on that. In this post, we'll see examples using `loadable-components` as I have never used `React.lazy` before.

### Code splitting: by page

Let's say we have a product with a Home page and a Search, the same way we talked before:

<img
  src="/web-performance-code-splitting-strategies-and-react-applications/2.code-splitting-by-page.png"
  loading="lazy"
/>

We want our app to be split into two separate bundles, one for the home and the other for the search.

To do this using the `loadable-components` lib, we can just create loadable components and dynamically import both search and home components.

```jsx
import loadable from '@loadable/component';

const Home = loadable(() => import('./Home'));
const Search = loadable(() => import('./Search'));
```

One caveat: both `Home` and `Search` components need to be default exported. If they are only exported using named export, it won't work (not only in `loadable-components`, but also in `react-loadable` and `React.lazy`).

After creating these components, we can use them on our routes. As we want to code split them per page.

If you are using `react-router`, the code would look like this:

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route exact path="/search" component={Search} />
</Switch>
```

Now, when the user accesses `https://domain.com`, it will download only the home bundle and not the search one. If the user accesses `https://domain.com/search`, it will be the other way around: downloading the search bundle but not the home.

We can make sure this works by looking at the network tab on the DevTools. There, you'll see all JavaScript being downloaded. Don't forget to filter by `JS` to make it easier to see JavaScript-related bundles only.

### Code splitting: below the fold

Cutting JavaScript that is below the fold and putting it in a separate bundle is a pretty nice strategy to reduce the bundle and serve only the necessary JavaScript to the user.

As we already talked about, we can implement that using the Intersection Observer API. I have already shown a simple code snippet on how to use the API but now I want to show an example in React. The concept is pretty much the same though.

I will show an example using a nice library called `react-intersection-observer`. The API is super simple to use and reason about. Take a look at it:

```jsx
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer';

const Component = () => {
  const { ref, inView } = useInView();
  // ...
};
```

For any component, we can use this hook and get interesting information from the observer. But the most important ones, at least for our performance case now, are the `ref` and the `inView`.

They have a pretty good naming and you can get from it. The `ref` is the reference of the component or element you want to observe. We can call it your target element as you need to assign this ref to the DOM element you want to monitor. And the `inView` is just a boolean telling you if this target element is in the intersection with the viewport or not.

If you want to try this out, consider creating a new component, and logging the `inView` in the console to see if it's working correctly. Try this out:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer';

const Component = () => {
  const { ref, inView, entry } = useInView();
  console.log({ inView });

  return <div ref={ref}></div>;
};
```

Now, every time you reach this component when scrolling down (or up) the page, you see a `{ inView: true }` in the DevTools console. Pretty nice, uh?

Now, back to the code splitting strategy. Imagine you have this "below the fold” component:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Below the fold title</h2>
      <p>Another code splitting strategy</p>
      // ...
    </div>
  );
};
```

We want to download the JavaScript only when the user reaches this component that's below the fold, right? The first step is to extract this component into a separate bundle. We do that the same way we did for the code splitting by page strategy, using the `loadable-components`.

Extract the component into a new file and default export it:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Below the fold title</h2>
      <p>Another code splitting strategy</p>
      // ...
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

Create a loadable component that will dynamically import it

```jsx
import loadable from '@loadable/component';

const LoadableComponent = loadable(() => import('./Component'));
```

With that, we can now use it in the target element we will be monitoring.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer';
import { LoadableComponent } from './LoadableComponent';

const Component = () => {
  const { ref, inView } = useInView();

  return <div ref={ref}>{inView && <LoadableComponent />}</div>;
};
```

Again using the `useInView` hook, assigning the `ref` to the target DOM element, and using the `inView` boolean to know if the component is in the intersection with the viewport or not. If it's, it will evaluate to `true` and render the `LoadableComponent`. Now the loadable will dynamically import the "below the fold" component, the browser will download the separate bundle, and it will be rendered for the user.

It's just a small example but it shows the whole concept. We can use it for any other type of component that's below the fold. We can make the bundle more granular or put everything in the same "below the fold" bundle.

### Code splitting: conditional content

The conditional content is very similar to the below the fold strategy. The concept is to code split components that are not visible in the first render, create a new separate bundle for them, and download them when the user wants to see this content.

One common example is Modals (or overlays, or dialogs, … so many names for the same thing❓). In the first load, the modal shouldn't be downloaded together with the main bundle. The user doesn't even know if exists yet. So we separate it into a new bundle and when the user clicks something to open this modal, we download it, and render it to the screen.

To the code! We start separating the modal component into a new file:

```jsx
const Modal = ({ isOpen }) => (
  <Container isOpen={isOpen}>
    <Header />
    <Content />
  </Container>
);

export default Modal;
```

Now we create the loadable:

```jsx
import loadable from '@loadable/component';

export const Modal = loadable(() => import('./Modal'));
```

With the two components created, now we should just render this modal when it should be open. If it's not open, we don't want to penalize the user with more JavaScript being downloaded. We can even use the `isOpen` flag to handle this condition for when to load and render the modal or not.

```jsx
import { Modal } from './Modal';

const Page = () => {
  // get the isOpen somehow

  return (
    <div>
      // ...
      {isOpen && <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Simple as that.
