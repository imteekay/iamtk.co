## Type

A type is a classification of data that defines the operations that can be done on that data, the meaning of the data, and the set of allowed values. Typing is checked by the compiler and/or run time to ensure the integrity of the data, enforce access restrictions, and interpret the data as meant by the developer.

## Type System

A type system is a set of rules that assigns and enforces types to elements of a programming language. These elements can be variables, func- tions, and other higher-level constructs. Type systems assign types through notation you provide in the code or implicitly by deducing the type of a cer- tain element based on context. They allow various conversions between types and disallow others.

## Type Checking

The process of type checking ensures that the rules of the type system are respected by the program. This type checking is done by the com- piler when converting the code or by the run time while executing the code. The component of the compiler that handles enforcement of the typing rules is called a type checker.

The main benefits of typing are correctness, immutability, encapsulation, composability, and readability.

## Correctness

Correct code means code that behaves according to its specification, producing expected results without creating run-time errors or crashes.

## Immutability

Making `x` a constant, we get a compilation error when we try to mutate it in the next listing.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the ability to hide some of the internals of our code. Encapsulation appears at multiple layers: a service exposes its API as an interface, a module exports its interface and hides implementation details, a class exposes only its public members, and so on.

## Composable

Having the ability to combine independent components yields a modular system and less code to maintain. In a composable system, the parts are loosely cou- pled; at the same time, code does not get duplicated in each subsystem.

Generic types enable us to express these kinds of abstractions.

## Type Inference

For many cases, the compiler can infer which is the type of a variable, a function return type. We don't need to provide the type notations.
