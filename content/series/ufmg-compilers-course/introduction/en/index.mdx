Compilers Engineers' goal is to bridge the gap between people and machines, programming languages and hardware, and make engineers more productive.

## Goals

### Code optimization. Measuring performance:

- time, space, energy consumption
- copy elimination, constant propagation, lazy code motion, register allocation, loop unrolling, value numbering, strength reduction

### Bug finding

- null pointer dereference, array out of bounds access, invalid class cast, tainted flow vulnerabilities, integer overflows, information leaks
