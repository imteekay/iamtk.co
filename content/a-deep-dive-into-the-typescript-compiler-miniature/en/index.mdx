<SmoothRender>

As you may know, I've been studying compilers. A lot. For the past month, I've been learning more about the TypeScript compiler, reading its source code, and implementing some of the exercises from the [mini-typescript](https://github.com/imteekay/mini-typescript).

In this post, I want to cover some of my learnings while reading the TypeScript compiler miniature's source code and implementing the exercises.

I divided this [series](/series/the-typescript-compiler) into three parts and the following posts to cover everything about the TypeScript compiler. The first two were already published and you can take a look at them here:

- [A High Level Architecture of the TypeScript compiler](/a-high-level-architecture-of-the-typescript-compiler)
- [JavaScript scope, Closures, and the TypeScript compiler](/javascript-scope-closures-and-the-typescript-compiler)

And now, in this post, I will cover different features of the [mini-typescript](https://github.com/imteekay/mini-typescript) and how they are implemented. For the exercises I implemented in the project, I will write new articles in the following posts of the [series](/series/the-typescript-compiler).

By the way, I think it's a good idea to read the first two posts before reading this if you don't know how compilers and the TypeScript compiler work. The first one will give a good overview of the steps of the compiler and how each piece fits together. The second one will talk about closures and how they are used to make the compiler more modular and easier to change and manage its state.

With the two pieces, I think you'll be ready to read how some of the features of the TypeScript miniature are implemented.

Let's go!

---

Before going into each feature, I just wanted to illustrate how the compiler structures each step. Basically, how it represents tokens in the lexer step, AST nodes in the parser, variable and type declarations in the binder, and types in the type checker.

## Representing tokens

The idea of a lexer is to go through character by character and produce a new token. It receives the source code as a string and starts from position `0`. In this simplest version, it has states like `pos` as the position of the current character it's analyzing, `token` as the token type of the produced token, and `text` that could be the name of an identifier (e.g. `age` from `var age = 1;`), a number value (e.g. `1`), a keyword (e.g. `var`), or a string value (e.g. `"string"`).

As an example, if we have this source code

```jsx
var age: number = 1;
```

The lexer will produce this list of tokens

- `var`:
  - `text`: “var”
  - `token`: “Var”
- `age`:
  - `text`: “age”
  - `token`: “Identifier”
- `:`:
  - `text`: undefined
  - `token`: “Colon”
- `number`:
  - `text`: “number”
  - `token`: “Identifier”
- `=`:
  - `text`: undefined
  - `token`: “Equals”
- `1`:
  - `text`: “1”
  - `token`: “NumericLiteral”
- `;`:
  - `text`: undefined
  - `token`: ”Semicolon”

In a visible way, it should look like this

## Representing AST nodes

AST nodes are basically `Statement`s. They can be `ExpressionStatement`, `Var`, `TypeAlias`, or `EmptyStatement`.

The type looks like a union of all these types

```tsx
type Statement = ExpressionStatement | Var | TypeAlias | EmptyStatement;
```

To have an idea of how AST nodes can be structured, let's take `ExpressionsStatement` as an example and see its data types and the transformation from source code to AST node.

The `ExpressionStatement` can be different expressions: `Identifier`, `NumericLiteral`, `Assignment`, or `StringLiteral`.

```tsx
type Expression = Identifier | NumericLiteral | Assignment | StringLiteral;
```

Each node can have different “attributes”. For example,

- `NumericLiteral` and `StringLiteral` can have a `value` attribute. For `NumericLiteral`, it's a number and for `StringLiteral`, it's a string.
- The `Identifier` has a `text` attribute, that's its name.
- The `Assignment` has the `name` and the `value`.

Let's see how we can represent each of these nodes — their data types

```tsx
interface Identifier {
  kind: Node.Identifier;
  text: string;
  pos: number;
}

interface Assignment {
  kind: Node.Assignment;
  name: Expression;
  value: Expression;
  pos: number;
}

interface NumericLiteral {
  kind: Node.NumericLiteral;
  value: number;
  pos: number;
}

interface StringLiteral {
  kind: Node.StringLiteral;
  value: string;
  pos: number;
}
```

This is already a good node representation of each.

Let's now see examples of each node.

An identifier with name `name`:

```tsx
// source code:
// name;

const identifier = {
  kind: 'Identifier',
  text: 'name',
  pos: 0,
};
```

An assignment with name `age` and value `1`:

```tsx
// source code:
// age = 1;

const assignment = {
  kind: 'Assignment',
  name: {
    // an identifier is an expression
    kind: 'Identifier',
    text: 'age',
    pos: 0,
  },
  value: {
    // a numeric literal is an expression
    kind: 'NumericLiteral',
    value: 1,
    pos: 1,
  },
  pos: 0,
};
```

A numeric literal:

```tsx
// source code:
// 1;

const numericLiteral = {
  kind: 'NumericLiteral',
  value: 1,
  pos: 0,
};
```

A string literal:

```tsx
// source code:
// 'hello';

const stringLiteral = {
  kind: 'StringLiteral',
  value: 'hello',
  pos: 0,
};
```

This already gives us a nice overview of how we can represent the source code in AST nodes. In the feature sections, we will dive deeper into each feature and see how this is used in the following steps like the binder and the type checker.

## Binder: storing the type and variable declarations

Here in the binder, one of its responsibilities is storing declarations of types and variables. The compiler stores it in a data structure and the statements or AST nodes can be “fetched” later on.

The data structure the compiler uses to store these declarations is a `Map`, a key-value data structure, where the key is the name of the identifier (name of the type or the variable) and the value is a list of statements.

The value is a list of statements because we can do this:

```tsx
type test = string;
var test = 'string';
```

For the same `test` identifier's name, we can have two different statements, and the best way to do it is to store them in a list of declarations. Later on, if we want to access one of the declarations, we need to pass the type of statement we're looking for, if it's a type or a variable.

For the above example, we would have the statements stored like this in the `Map`:

```tsx
Map(1) {
  'test' => [
    // The Variable AST node
    {
      kind: Node.Var,
      name: {
        kind: 'Identifier',
        text: 'test',
      },
      init: {
        kind: 'StringLiteral',
        value: 'string',
      },
    },
    // The Type Alias AST node
    {
      kind: Node.TypeAlias,
      name: {
        kind: 'Identifier',
        text: 'test',
      },
      init: {
        kind: 'Identifier',
        text: 'string',
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

For the same identifier name `test`, it has a list of declarations, a variable statement and a type alias statement,

So now, the compiler can use this data structure and query the statements. To resolve it, we pass the name and the type of the statement we are looking for.

```tsx
const symbol = locals.get(name);

if (symbol?.declarations.some((d) => d.kind === type)) {
  return symbol;
}
```

What's happening here?

- It gets the symbol based on the `name`
- and then it tries to find the declaration statement based on the `type`, where `type` can be either `Var` or `TypeAlias`.

For every AST node created from the parser, the binder will handle them and figure out if it should add it or not to the `Map`. And then the type checker can resolve the statement whenever it needs to check the types. This is valuable when the type checker reaches the

## Values in the type checker

In general, the type checker will do two things: one is to generate a type structure for each node and the second is to compare these types.

For expressions like strings and numbers, it should return the `stringType` and `numberType`. The shape of these types is simple:

```tsx
const stringType: Type = { id: 'string' };
const numberType: Type = { id: 'number' };
```

For statements like variable declaration and assignment, it will compare the returned type from the value and the identifier's type. If you have this variable declaration example:

```tsx
var num: number = '123';
     ⎸
     ↳ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

It should provide a type error like it was illustrated above, right? The type checker should only compare these two nodes: the identifier `num` with the type `NumericLiteral` and the expression `'123'` with the type `StringLiteral`. We clearly see a mismatch between these two types and the compiler attaches this new error to the “store of errors” or a `Map` of errors.

For assignments, it works pretty much the same way:

```tsx
var num: number = 123;

num = '123';
 ⎸
 ↳ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

But now it needs to go to the binder and ask for the identifier `num`. It will try to resolve it, get the symbol, and generate the related type. Then it just compares the generated type with the value type.

We are going to see more of this in-depth later on in cases like variable declarations and assignments.

---

Now that we understand how each part of the compiler represents characters, tokens, and AST nodes, let's get some features and unpack how they were implemented.

We go from the lexer, passing to the parser and binder, and ending in the type checker.

## `NumericLiteral`: handling numbers

We first start with the lexer. There it will scan characters and transform them into tokens. For `NumericLiteral`s, it needs to read numbers from the source code. This is what we'll be looking for.

The first part is to check if the current character is a possible number.

```tsx
if (/[0-9]/.test(s.charAt(pos))) {
  // ...
}
```

Using regular expressions, we can accomplish this. Check if the character in the position `pos` passes the regex test for any number from 0 to 9. If this character is the one, we know it's a `NumericLiteral`.

Numbers can be just one digit or more. To make sure it gets the entire number, we should keep scanning until we “finish” the number.

Now I want to present to you the function `scanForward`. It keeps scanning the source code and moving forward if the predicate is true.

```tsx
function scanForward(pred: (x: string) => boolean) {
  while (pos < s.length && pred(s.charAt(pos))) pos++;
}
```

We also make sure we stop the loop if it reaches the end of the source code. The `pred` is just a predicate function, it will receive the current character and return a boolean, if the character passes the check or not.

In this case, the predicate is if the current character is a number.

```tsx
function isNumber(c: string) {
  return /[0-9]/.test(c);
}
```

So if we run this code:

```tsx
scanForward(isNumber);
```

It will keep scanning forward until it reaches the end of the number or the end of the source code. That's it. Before any operation starts in the lexer, we store the `start` position. When it finishes scanning the entire number, the position `pos` goes to the last index of the number. To get the `text`, we should just slice that:

```tsx
text = s.slice(start, pos);
```

And to finish it, the token should be a `NumericLiteral`.

```tsx
token = Token.NumericLiteral;
```

Now that the compiler finished the “tokenization”, we are now in the parsing process.

Remember that the parser has an instance of the lexer? The instance has functions like `scan`, `token`, `text`, and `pos`.

Before start understanding the parser, let's recall the structure we want to generate for the `NumericLiteral`. You should remember that a number is an expression, so the structure will look like this:

```tsx
{
  kind: Node.ExpressionStatement;
  pos: number;
  expr: {
    kind: Node.NumericLiteral;
    value: number;
    pos: number;
  }
}
```

We should have a statement, more specifically, an expression statement, and the expression is a number. The number will have `NumericLiteral` as its `kind`, the value (e.g. the number `1` will be the `value` if the source code is `1;`), and the position `pos` of the statement.

The parser tries to parse all kinds of statements before an expression, if it doesn't parse anything, it tries parsing the expression. This is the returned value when parsing the statements:

```tsx
{ kind: Node.ExpressionStatement, expr: parseExpression(), pos };
```

When parsing the expression, we want to see if it can parse a number, so it uses a function called `tryParseToken`. That's a very interesting function:

```tsx
function tryParseToken(expected: Token) {
  const ok = lexer.token() === expected;
  if (ok) {
    lexer.scan();
  }
  return ok;
}
```

If it's the expected token, in this case, the `Token.NumericLiteral`, it will scan and return if it's the expected one. That's interesting because it can be used like this:

```tsx
if (tryParseToken(Token.NumericLiteral)) {
  return { kind: Node.NumericLiteral, value: +lexer.text(), pos };
}
```

That's exactly what we need to create the number AST node.

- It tries to parse the token `Token.NumericLiteral` and the current token is the expected one
- It just returns the `NumericLiteral` AST node: take a look that it “cast” the text into a number with the `+` sign (take a look at [unary plus +](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary_plus))

And now we have the full AST node for the expression statement.

The binder doesn't do anything regarding the number as we learned that one of its responsibilities is to store the variable and type declarations.

The type checker just produces a number type as we've seen early on. This part is super straightforward. It checks every statement, so when it gets to the expressions and the current expression is a `Node.NumericLiteral`, it just returns a `numberType`, which is this structure:

```tsx
const numberType: Type = { id: 'number' };
```

This type will be helpful and used to compare the types between statements and check if we have any type mismatch, or as we usually say a "type error".

## Var: handling variable declarations

As we've seen before. This is an important type as it will be used for the comparison of types in other checks.

Let's see another statement that's even more interesting. We'll be talking about the variable declaration. Let's understand how the compiler parses and type checks this source code:

```tsx
var num: number = 1;
```

In the tokenization process, let's start with the simplest tokens: Equals (`=`), Semicolon (`;`), and Colon (`:`).

This part is straightforward. If the current character is one of these mentioned earlier, we just assign the right token for that. The code will look pretty much like this:

```tsx
case '=':
  token = Token.Equals;
  break;
case ';':
  token = Token.Semicolon;
  break;
case ':':
  token = Token.Colon;
  break;
```

These tokens will be helpful to parse the entire variable declaration. For example, at least in the first version, the declaration will always expect the `Equals` token after the identifier or the typename.

Now we need to create tokens for the `var`, the name identifier (the name of the variable), and the typename identifier (the name of the type).

All of them are “alphabetical characters” and this is the first hint. Whenever the current character is an alphabetical char, we know we can be scanning a keyword or an identifier. Both will be implemented in the same way.

This looks pretty similar to the `NumericLiteral` we've seen before:

```tsx
if (/[_a-zA-Z]/.test(s.charAt(pos))) {
  // ...
}
```

But now we are looking at alphabetical characters rather than numbers. We even do scanning the same way using the `scanForward` we used before. Identifier can have numbers in its name, so the predicate will be if the character is an alphanumeric char. Here it's:

```tsx
function isAlphanumerical(c: string) {
  return /[_a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(c);
}
```

Let's scan forward all the way to the end of the keyword or the identifier:

```tsx
scanForward(isAlphanumerical);
```

The `text` will be a simple slice between the start position to the end position:

```tsx
text = s.slice(start, pos);
```

And the token is when we separate what's a keyword and what's an identifier. The whole idea is: if the `text` belongs to the “keywords” list, it's a keyword, if not, it's an identifier. This is the “list”, or better, the object:

```tsx
const keywords = {
  function: Token.Function,
  var: Token.Var,
  type: Token.Type,
  return: Token.Return,
};
```

To handle this logic, we use a simple ternary together with the [`in` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in):

```tsx
token =
  text in keywords ? keywords[text as keyof typeof keywords] : Token.Identifier;
```

That's the whole implementation:

```ts
if (/[_a-zA-Z]/.test(s.charAt(pos))) {
  scanForward(isAlphanumerical);
  text = s.slice(start, pos);
  token =
    text in keywords
      ? keywords[text as keyof typeof keywords]
      : Token.Identifier;
}
```

And that's it, the lexer part for the whole variable declaration is done.

Again, this is how it looks like:

<img
  src="/a-deep-dive-into-the-typescript-compiler-miniature/lexer-variable-declaration.png"
  class="full"
  loading="lazy"
/>

Now that we have all the tokens for the variable declaration, let's parse them into an AST node. In the end, it will look like this:

```tsx
{
  "kind": "Var",
  "name": {
    "kind": "Identifier",
    "text": "num"
  },
  "typename": {
    "kind": "Identifier",
    "text": "number"
  },
  "init": {
    "kind": "NumericLiteral",
    "value": 1
  }
}
```

This is an AST node with type `Var`, the name is an identifier `num`, the typename is also an identifier but a `number`, and the init is the initial value expression, in this case, a `NumericLiteral` with value `1`.

This is the main logic to parse a variable declaration:

```tsx
if (tryParseToken(Token.Var)) {
  const name = parseIdentifier();
  const typename = tryParseToken(Token.Colon)
    ? parseIdentifier()
    : undefined;
  parseExpected(Token.Equals);
  const init = parseExpression();
  return { kind: Node.Var, name, typename, init, pos };
}
```

There are a lot of things going on here, let's unpack it.

First, we use `tryParseToken` to see if it's an actual `Token.Var` token. If it's, we know how this structure should be. The first part of this node is the `name`. It should be an identifier, so it calls the `parseIdentifier` function to parse it.

To create the AST node regarding the identifier, it tries to parse the token `Token.Identifier` and it returns the whole structure, like this:

```tsx
if (tryParseToken(Token.Identifier)) {
  return { kind: Node.Identifier, text: lexer.text(), pos };
}
```

The second part of the `Var` node is the typename. But types are optional in TypeScript, so it tries to parse the `Token.Colon` token, if it passes, we expect to parse the type, which's an identifier too, so it just calls `parseIdentifier` again. If it doesn't have the `Token.Colon` token, the `typename` will be `undefined`. This gives the optionality feature for TypeScript.

The third part is the `=` token. In JavaScript, it is totally possible to write variable declarations without an initial value, like this:

```tsx
var num;
```

But in this initial implementation of the compiler miniature, it'll require it to have the assignment and the initial value.

To make it a requirement, it just needs to expect the `=` token. We'll use a function called `parseExpected`:

```tsx
function parseExpected(expected: Token) {
  if (!tryParseToken(expected)) {
    error(
      lexer.pos(),
      `parseToken: Expected ${Token[expected]} but got ${Token[lexer.token()]}`,
    );
  }
}
```

If it doesn't parse the expected token, the `=` token in this case, it will add a new error to the compiler's `Map` of errors. If it parses, it just moves forward to the next token. And the next token is an expression.

An expression being a `NumericLiteral` is already implemented so we covered everything for that specific source code. We can see the implementation of different types of expressions like `StringLiteral`s and `Identifier`s, but this will be a topic for future posts in this [series](/series/the-typescript-compiler).

We're now missing the implementation of the binder and the type checker for variables.

The binder can be intimidating at first but the code is super simple. If you've already practiced and solved [algorithm problems](/series/algorithms-problem-solving), you probably already came across algorithms that you need to add values to a `Map`. The binder is pretty similar:

- Get a symbol from the `Map`
- If it has the key, add a new value to the list
- If it doesn't, add the first value to the list

Let's see the whole code first:

```tsx
if (statement.kind === Node.Var || statement.kind === Node.TypeAlias) {
  const symbol = locals.get(statement.name.text);
  if (symbol) {
    const other = symbol.declarations.find((d) => d.kind === statement.kind);
    if (other) {
      error(
        statement.pos,
        `Cannot redeclare ${statement.name.text}; first declared at ${other.pos}`,
      );
    } else {
      symbol.declarations.push(statement);
      if (statement.kind === Node.Var) {
        symbol.valueDeclaration = statement;
      }
    }
  } else {
    locals.set(statement.name.text, {
      declarations: [statement],
      valueDeclaration: statement.kind === Node.Var ? statement : undefined,
    });
  }
}
```

Let's unpack the idea of the statement binding.

In this initial implementation, we are handling only `Node.Var` and `Node.TypeAlias`.

The first step is to try to get a symbol from the `Map`. It queries the symbol based on the statement name.

```tsx
const symbol = locals.get(statement.name.text);
```

- If it does have a symbol in the `Map`, we should add a new statement to the declarations list (a couple more things we are going to see)
- If it doesn't, we should just set the statement as the first declaration in the declarations list

Before adding a new statement to a given symbol, we should see if the source code is trying to redeclare the same variable or the same type again because we should get an error if we write code like this:

```tsx
var a = 1;
var a = 2;
```

In real JavaScript, `var` allows us to redeclare the same name. In the following posts of the [series](/series/the-typescript-compiler), we'll see a new implementation of the `Let` statement and how it shouldn't allow redeclaring the same statement. But in this first implementation, `var` won't allow it.

To add this rule to the statement binding, the binder needs to look at the declarations list of the current symbol and check if there's a statement with the same kind as the current statement.

In the source code above, it adds the first statement to the declarations list with the key as `a`. When it goes to the second statement, it tries to find any other statement with the same kind, “var” in this case, and it finds it. We do it using the Array's `find` method.

```tsx
const other = symbol.declarations.find((d) => d.kind === statement.kind);
```

If we find it, we know we should report an error. And this is done:

```tsx
if (other) {
  error(
    statement.pos,
    `Cannot redeclare ${statement.name.text}; first declared at ${other.pos}`,
  );
}
```

If we couldn't find it, the binder just follows the same flow: add the new statement to the list of declarations.

I won't talk too much about `valueDeclaration` but this will be super useful in the type checking process for identifier and assignment expressions.

When we talked about the type checker early on, I wrote that expressions return their own type, so we can use them to compare, see if it has any type mismatch, and report an error if that's the case.

In variable declarations, we also should return their own type, but we can have two different scenarios:

```tsx
// variable without a typename
var num = 1;

// variable with a typename
var num: number = 1;
```

Variables with and without the typename. The logic is very simple.

- If it doesn't have the typename, it should just return the type related to the value expression. In the above example, it should return the type related to `1`, in other words, it should return the `numberType`
- If it does have the typename, it should return the typename's type. In the above example, it should return the type related to `number`, in other words, it should return the `numberType`

Here's the implementation of this logic

```tsx
function checkStatement(statement: Statement): Type {
  switch (statement.kind) {
    case Node.Var:
      const i = checkExpression(statement.init);
      if (!statement.typename) {
        return i;
      }
      const t = checkType(statement.typename);
      if (t !== i && t !== errorType)
        error(
          statement.init.pos,
          `Cannot assign initialiser of type '${typeToString(
            i,
          )}' to variable with declared type '${typeToString(t)}'.`,
        );
      return t;
    // ...
  }
}
```

Let's unpack this code:

- First, it checks the `init` expression. It can be related to any expression. One example is if the expression is `1`, it will return the `numberType`
- Then it checks if there's a typename. If not, it should just return the type related to the `init` expression
- If there's a typename, it will get the type related to it. In the case of an identifier like `number`, it will check its type and return the `numberType`
- If the types produced before don't match, we have a “type error” and it reports the error to the `Map` of errors
- In the end, it will return the type related to the typename

If there's no typename, it favors the value or expression type. If there's a typename, it favors the typename type.

For variable declarations, we are always comparing and checking if the types match and return the favored type.

## `Assignment`: handling assignment operations

Let's first see a simple example of an assignment:

```tsx
var num: number = 1;

// assigning `2` to `num`
num = 2;
```

If we separate the tokens that are part of this source code, we get:

- `num`: an `Identifier`
- `=`: an `Equals`
- `2`: an `Expression`, more specifically a `NumericLiteral`

You probably noticed we don't need to implement anything new in the lexer as we already have all the tokens in place, and that's great! Let's go straight to the parser then.

As you already know, the `Assignment` node is an expression statement. For this source code:

```tsx
num = 2;
```

We get this AST node:

```tsx
{
  "kind": "ExpressionStatement",
  "expr": {
    "kind": "Assignment",
    "name": {
      "kind": "Identifier",
      "text": "num"
    },
    "value": {
      "kind": "NumericLiteral",
      "value": 2
    }
  }
}
```

It's

- An expression statement
- The expression is an `Assignment`
- The assignment is separated into two pieces:
  - `name`: usually an identifier, in this case, the text `num`
  - `value`: usually an expression, in this case, the numeric literal `2`

Let's parse it then.

When parsing an expression, we have a function to handle that. It's called `parseExpression`:

```tsx
function parseExpression(): Expression {
  const pos = lexer.pos();
  const e = parseIdentifierOrLiteral();
  if (e.kind === Node.Identifier && tryParseToken(Token.Equals)) {
    return { kind: Node.Assignment, name: e, value: parseExpression(), pos };
  }
  return e;
}
```

The first step is to parse an identifier or a literal (it can be a numeric or a string literal). It will always return an expression. If it returns an identifier and then the current token is the `Equals`, we know that's an `Assignment` expression.

Now we know it's an assignment and we have the identifier. The only thing missing is the value expression. And we just need to call `parseExpression` again and it will parse it for us.

That's interesting because it covers both possible scenarios:

- when the value expression is a literal, e.g. `1` or `'string'`
- and when the value expression is an identifier, e.g. `num`, as you may know, we can assign the value of a variable to another, like the following example

```tsx
var num = 1;
var n = 2;

// assigning the value of
// an identifier (variable)
// into another identifier (another variable)
n = num;
```

And that's it! We have a working AST node for the `Assignment`.

In the binder, the compiler just handles `Var` and `TypeAlias` nodes, so we don't need to do anything else there.

The whole idea of type checking the assignment expression is to type check expressions in general because it should get the type related to the identifier and related to the value expression, and then compare them.

This is how we translate the logic above into code.

```tsx
const v = checkExpression(expression.value);
const t = checkExpression(expression.name);
if (t !== v)
  error(
    expression.value.pos,
    `Cannot assign value of type '${typeToString(
      v,
    )}' to variable of type '${typeToString(t)}'.`,
  );
return t;
```

What does it do?

- check the value expression
- check the identifier expression
- compare them and see if they match. If not, report an error to the `Map` of errors
- and return the identifier type

But what's this `checkExpression` function? This is the whole function

```tsx
function checkExpression(expression: Expression): Type {
  switch (expression.kind) {
    case Node.Identifier:
      const symbol = resolve(module.locals, expression.text, Node.Var);
      if (symbol) {
        return checkStatement(symbol.valueDeclaration!);
      }
      error(expression.pos, 'Could not resolve ' + expression.text);
      return errorType;
    case Node.NumericLiteral:
      return numberType;
    case Node.StringLiteral:
      return stringType;
    case Node.Assignment:
      const v = checkExpression(expression.value);
      const t = checkExpression(expression.name);
      if (t !== v)
        error(
          expression.value.pos,
          `Cannot assign value of type '${typeToString(
            v,
          )}' to variable of type '${typeToString(t)}'.`,
        );
      return t;
  }
}
```

It seems a bit intimidating but it's not that hard to understand. Let's unpack it.

`NumericLiteral` and `StringLiteral` aren’t difficult to understand. We've seen them before. They just return simple types: `numberType` and `stringType`.

When calling the `checkExpression` in the assignment block, we can fall into three possibilities:

- `Identifier`
- `NumericLiteral`
- `StringLiteral`

The type for the expression's name will probably be an identifier type. And the type of the expression's value can fall into these three categories. Let's see some examples:

```tsx
var num: number = 1;
var s: string = 'string';
var n: number = num;
```

- The first line falls down into the name being an identifier and the value expression a numeric literal
- The second line falls down into the name being an identifier and the value expression a string literal
- The third line falls down into the name being an identifier and the value expression also an identifier

The most interesting part of the expression type checking is the case of an identifier expression.

Whenever it needs to type check an identifier, it first uses the `resolve` function to query a symbol from the binder's `Map`.

If it finds the symbol, it checks the value declaration and returns its related type.

If it doesn't find any symbol, it couldn't resolve it and it should report a new error to the `Map` of errors.

## `TypeAlias`: handling named types

If we untangle the type alias, we can see we already implemented everything about it in the lexer phase.

```tsx
type age = number;
```

- `type`: it's part of the keywords
- `age`: it's an identifier
- `number`: also an identifier

That's the structure of a type alias: the `type` keyword, the name of the type (identifier), the equals token, and the typename (identifier).

```tsx
if (tryParseToken(Token.Type)) {
  const name = parseIdentifier();
  parseExpected(Token.Equals);
  const typename = parseIdentifier();
  return { kind: Node.TypeAlias, name, typename, pos };
}
```

We only start creating the type alias AST node if we can parse the `Token.Type` token.

And this is an example of a node created in the parsing phrase:

```tsx
{
  "kind": "TypeAlias",
  "name": {
    "kind": "Identifier",
    "text": "age"
  },
  "typename": {
    "kind": "Identifier",
    "text": "number"
  }
}
```

This is the structure of the source code we saw above.

In the binder, we don't really need to implement anything else because it was already taken care of as it handles `Var` and `TypeAlias` statements. Type alias statements will follow the same flow and logic as the variable declarations.

One interesting point here is that we can't redeclare variables or redeclare types, but we can have a type and a variable with the same name. And it's already implemented the binder.

Because we already implemented most of the type checker, checking type aliases became super easy. One of the things we need to do is to add this line of code:

```tsx
case Node.TypeAlias:
  return checkType(statement.typename);
```

If the statement is a `TypeAlias`, we should check the type of `typename`. Calling `checkType`, it will fall into three possibilities:

- `typename` as `NumericLiteral`: it should return a `numberType`
- `typename` as `StringLiteral`: it should return a `stringType`
- `typename` as `TypeAlias`: it should resolve a type alias symbol from the `Map` of declarations. If it finds the symbol, it calls `checkType` again but now with the `typename` of the declaration it found in the `Map` built in the binder

This is the whole code:

```tsx
function checkType(name: Identifier): Type {
  switch (name.text) {
    case 'string':
      return stringType;
    case 'number':
      return numberType;
    default:
      const symbol = resolve(module.locals, name.text, Node.TypeAlias);
      if (symbol) {
        return checkType(
          (
            symbol.declarations.find(
              (d) => d.kind === Node.TypeAlias,
            ) as TypeAlias
          ).typename,
        );
      }
      error(name.pos, 'Could not resolve type ' + name.text);
      return errorType;
  }
}
```

Just a tiny additional piece of info: if the `resolve` couldn't find the type alias typename in the `Map` of declarations, it should report an error in the `Map` of errors.

If the source code is like this:

```tsx
type N = number;
type S = string;
```

It will fall into the two first possibilities: it returns the type for typename and they are `numberType` and `stringType`.

For a source code like this:

```tsx
type N = number;
type Num = N;
```

It will fall into the third possibility, where `N` is a `TypeAlias` and we should query it in the `Map` of declarations we built in the binder. Resolving it, we find that its `typename` is `number` and then it returns `numberType` for the `Num` type alias.

## Final words

In this piece of content, my goal was to show two main things:

- The data structures used in each phase of the compiler
- How some features are implemented to understand each phrase more in-depth

I hope it can be a nice source of knowledge to understand more about the TypeScript compiler and compilers in general. This was a full dump of my last 3 months I've been studying, researching, and working on the TS compiler miniature.

This is a [series](/series/the-typescript-compiler) of posts about compilers and if you didn't have the chance to see the previous two posts, take a look at them:
