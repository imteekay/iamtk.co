I'm learning a lot about building new projects using Typescript. Today I want to tell you more about building things with constant feedback and how to make the development dynamic.

At first, when I started building things with Typescript, for every function I built, I had two options:

1. Execute the file by using `ts-node`.
2. Open a repl with `ts-node` and copy and paste the function there.

At first, it is ok to test simple things. But you all need to stop the development and lose the flow. I wanted a more dynamic development flow and I found `nodemon`.

`nodemon` is not specific for Typescript. It is a

> Tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. - nodemon.io

So, for every file you saved, `nodemon` will restart the application. With that, you can have constant feedback from what you are building.

## Setting up

If you really like this tooling, you can install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

But I like to configure dependencies for each project. So I install it in the dev dependencies in the project I want to use it.

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

After installing it, we have to configure the nodemon json config. This is the simple configuration I did for my [publisher tool](/publisher-a-tooling-to-automate-the-process-to-publish-my-blog-posts):

```json
{
  "watch": ["src", "examples"],
  "ext": ".ts,.js,.html,.json",
  "ignore": [],
  "exec": "ts-node ./src/index.ts"
}
```

It watches the `src` and `example` folders with `.ts`, `.js`, `.html`, and `.json` files. If one of these files changes, the nodemon executes your main file defined in the `exec` property. In my project, I add the main file in the `./src/index.ts`.

In your `package.json`, you can add a script to handle nodemon:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start:dev": "nodemon"
  }
}
```

Run the command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

And now your app is up and running.. with constant feedback.

As I said earlier, dynamic feedback is really important in development mode. It helps you have instant feedback as early as possible, making it breaking and working faster.

For your next project, I really recommend you to play around with this library. Or set up a different tool to make your development more dynamic.
