_My notes on the "[How to Learn Complex Skills Quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHN7BXpdAPQ)" by Justin Sung_

---

Why complex topics are hard to learn?

- Complex skills take trial and error, over and over again
- Latent Learning
  - The latency between “Learning” and “Feedback”
  - The more complex the topic of study is, the latency is bigger and the feedback is more distant from the learning

Question: Am I moving in the right direction?

- Help with noticing if we are deviating from the right track
- It's possible to answer this question with the RAIL framework

## RAIL Framework

### **R**elevance

- Feel lost and confuse, mindblank, overwhelming
- Progressing in this stage feels like discovering new variables and irrelevant topics start to become relevant
- Actions
  - Exploration: spend time to understand the skill
    - Get diverse opinions from others
    - Learn the theory behind
  - Challenging: be open minded to other beliefs and assumptions
    - What we think what it's important right now, might not be correct

### **A**wareness

- It's also called the plato period. That period you don't see much progress
- It's an important stage where you're doing a lot of mistakes and be aware of and not being afraid of these mistakes is the the key to make progress
- e.g. to be able to do it correctly for the first time, you need to X mistakes, let's say 100 mistakes. The more aware of this mistakes you make and internalize how important it's to make them, it's crucial to make progress in this stage
- When making progress in this stage, we are doing less and less mistakes
- Actions
  - Experimentation: trying to perform the skill and making mistakes
  - Reflection: thinking about why you made those mistakes
    - What am I missing? What are the variables I'm not considering?
    - Gather feedback (we don't know what we don't know)

### **I**teration

- In this stage, we because it's a brand new skill, it takes a lot of effort, we're not very consistent, and it's pretty slow
- Able to perform the technique correctly at least once or twice
- Not discovering new mistakes but struggling to overcome them
- Signs of progress
  - Consistent execution of the skill (make it correctly more consistently)
  - Execution become easier and faster
- Actions
  - Varied practice
    - Different levels of challenges, context, and conditions
    - Different subjects, workload, mediums, difficulties
  - Adjust
    - Observing and fine-tuning

### **L**ifelong

- It's when the new skill becomes a new habit
- Avoid skill decay
  - Refining it
  - Regularly use it
