When running this code:

```js
function printGreeting() {
  const greeting = 'Hola amigos!';
  console.log(greeting);
}
```

- There's a lightbulb after the `greeting` variable declaration
- How the items get displayed when clicking on it?
- How this experience is uniform across editor?

## Trigger Event

- The cursor is in a spot where a code fix (or refactoring) can be applied.
- Manually invoked (via a key binding)

Handling the trigger event

- The editor records the position (line and column)
- The editor records the content type

In visual studio code you can use the LSP (Language Server Protocol). But it can also be done by hooking up an extension to the code action like ESLint.

## TSServer: The language server

A node executable that encapsulates the TypeScript compiler and language services and exposes them through a JSON protocol.

Isn't this just `tsc`? No, TSServer isn't resposible for compilation.
